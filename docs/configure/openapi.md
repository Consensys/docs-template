# Configure OpenAPI docs

There are currently no plugins available to support OpenAPI in Docusaurus 3. Please refer to the solution implemented in the [Web3Signer REST API documentation](https://docs.web3signer.consensys.io/reference/api/rest).

This page will be updated when there is a plugin available from Redocusaurus or Palo Alto OpenAPI.

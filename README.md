# Consensys docs template and guide

This repository is a template for creating new Consensys documentation sites.
It's built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

It also contains a written guide for contributing to Consensys docs, and creating, configuring, and
testing new doc sites, published at
[`docs-template.consensys.net`](https://docs-template.consensys.net/).

## Linting

Vale is a work in progress (WIP) for linting: `.github/workflows/lint.yml` uses actions set up on
Consensys/docs-gha/lint@main.

WIP: That GHA repo should be set up to apply the [Vale linting set](https://github.com/ConsenSys/docs-gha/tree/main/spelling).

### Let's Upset Vale

The title should do it, so should:

- Metamask
- ConsenSys
